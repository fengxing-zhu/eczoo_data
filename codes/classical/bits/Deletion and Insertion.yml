code_id: insertion_and_deletion
physical: bits
logical: bits


name: 'Insertion and deletion code'
introduced: '\cite{Binary codes capable of correcting deletions, insertions and reversals. Soviet Physics Dokl.10(8):707-710,1966}'


description: 'The codes capable of correcting insertions, where a new symbol is added somewhere within the string and deletions, that is, a symbol being removed without replacement.'


protection: 'Protects against deletions and insertions'



  rate: 'For binary codes, the optimal achievable rate to protect against a \( \delta \) fraction of insertions and deletions is \( 1- \mathcal{O}(\delta log\frac{1}{\delta} \).For the large alphabet setting, there exists a code which corrects \( \delta \) fraction of insertions and deletions and has the rate of \((1-\Omega)^5 \)'
