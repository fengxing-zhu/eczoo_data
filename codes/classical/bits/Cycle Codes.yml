name: 'cycle code of graphs '
introduced: '\cite{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/394711}'


description: 'Let \(G\) be a finite, undirected, connected graph without loops and multiple edges.The graph \(G\) has (\r\) vertices and \(n\) edges. Its parity check matrix (\H\) is defined as follows.(\H\) is an (\ r \times n\) matrix whose rows are indexed by the vertices of \(G\) and whose columns are indexed by the edges of \(G\), and such that \(H_{ij}=1\) if vertex \(i\) belongs to the edge \(j\) and \(H_{ij}=0\) otherwise.'


  rate: 'k=n-r+1.'

    - code_id: surface
      detail: 'The surface codes are a family of quantum error correcting codes defined on a 2D lattice of qubits. Each code within this family has stabilizers that are defined equivalently in the bulk, but differ from one another in their boundary conditions.'
    - code_id: toric 
      detail: 'The toric code is defined on a two-dimensional lattice, usually chosen to be the square lattice, with a spin-\(\frac{1}{2}\) degree of freedom located on each edge. They are chosen to be periodic.'
